I will continue to develop and improve my ability to use SQL. 
This lab requires me to complete more sophisticated queries, analysis, and presentation of results than lab 1 did. 

For lab 2 I will write SQL queries to retrieve data from two different databases -- yelp, and HealthyRide. 
Both databases are available on the AWS Aurora server that I have been using in data management class. 

Datasets:

Dataset 1: Yelp

The Yelp database contains a sample of businesses, users, and reviews for businesses in the Phoenix, Arizona area. For more information about Yelp! see www.yelp.com Links to an external site. 
 

Dataset 2: HealthyRide

The HealthyRide dataset contains information on the bicycles, stations, repairs, and rentals for Pittsburgh's HealthyRide bike share system. It also contains daily weather data for the time period covered by the dataset.
