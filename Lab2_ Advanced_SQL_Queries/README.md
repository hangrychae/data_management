I will continue to develop and improve my ability to use SQL. 
This lab requires me to complete more sophisticated queries, analysis, and presentation of results than lab 1 did. 

For lab 2 I will write SQL queries to retrieve data from two different databases -- yelp, and HealthyRide. 
Both databases are available on the AWS Aurora server that I have been using in data management class.
