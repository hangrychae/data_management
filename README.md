SQL-based data management 

Data drives modern business. Transactional data systems keep the worldâ€™s economy 
operating smoothly by tracking and processing the movement of bits, money, atoms, and 
attention across the planet. Analytic systems help managers understand and optimize 
their businesses. Robotic systems (both physical machines and software bots) are 
automating a tremendous amount of the work that has historically been done by people.  
 
This is a set of data management tools I have used to capture, manage, analyze, and understand data so that I can do business better, 
faster, and cheaper.  

Mechanical learning objectives: 
o  Write SQL queries to retrieve data from a relational database 
o  Setup, connect to, and retrieve data from, database servers in the cloud via 
Amazon Web Services (AWS) 
o  Repair or otherwise appropriately deal with data quality problems to improve 
the quality of a given data set 
o  Use data wrangling tools such as Tableau Data Prep to profile, clean, and 
transform datasets  
o  Import the results of a SQL query into Excel or Tableau for further analysis, 
manipulation, and presentation 
o  Explore, analyze, and visualize data with Tableau  
o  Capture, represent, analyze, and otherwise and manipulate loosely-
structured data using JSON and NoSQL tools 
 
Conceptual learning objectives:  
o  Present the results of your data exploration and analysis to others in a 
concise and compelling way. 
o  Explain the concept of data quality and the most common qualities 
evaluated, including completeness, consistency, accuracy, and timeliness. 
o  Assess the qualities of a given data set, including identifying specific data 
quality problems within a given dataset 
o  Improve the quality of a given dataset through data transformation, cleaning, 
and wrangling techniques
